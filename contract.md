# CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract (davidm12-gcredi2-lzefran2)

### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** We will meet once a week every Wednesday from 5-7 PM using Discord. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Luca. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

3. **Respect** Design decisions can be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. More information about design conflicts are in the Conflict Resolution section.


### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** The work will be split up as follows: David will work on the BFS implementation, Garrett and Luca will work on the data gathering and parsing, Garrett will work on the Dijkstra's Algorithm implementation, and Luca and David will work on the Graph layer output algorithm. If for whatever reason, a given person/pair has trouble on part of their task for the week, they will discuss it in the weekly meeting or in the discord and one of the project members will assist them.
2. **Time Commitment** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the 
   project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with 
   the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution** For 3 way splits, decisions will be made via a random number generator (random.org) with each member having their decision designated a given number.
