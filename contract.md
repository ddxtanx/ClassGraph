# CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract (davidm12-gcredi2-lzefran2)

### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** We will meet once a week every Wednesday from 5-7 PM using Discord. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Luca. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the "project lead" for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. More information about design conflicts are in the Conflict Resolution section.


### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team
   and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members
   will be randomly assigned the task.
2. **Time Commitment** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the 
   project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with 
   the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution** For 3 way splits, decisions will be made via a random number generator (random.org) with each member having their decision designated a given number.
