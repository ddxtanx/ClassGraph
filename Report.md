  Our final project run outputs three files: A Text File showing the betweenness centrality of each vertex within the dataset,
a text file showing the list of the vertices visited when iterating through our graph, and a PNG of the layered graph drawing 
showing the prerequisite tree of the selected vertex. One runs our program as described in the ReadMe.
