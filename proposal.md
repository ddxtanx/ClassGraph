## Project Proposal (davidm12, gcredi2, lzefran2)

1. **Leading Question** Given a class in the UIUC CS, ECE, Physics, and Mathematics departments, we would like to find the shortest possible sequence of classes to satisfy the classâ€™ prerequisites and we would like student's to be able to visualize how different classes interact and lead to other classes by printing out the prerec chains in the departments.

2. **Data Acquisition & Processing** We will use data from the CIS API to get data for all the courses offered in the various departments in Fall of 2021. From that, we will parse the descriptions to get the class prerequisites for all of the relevant courses. 

3. **Algorithms**
We will be implementing BFS, Dijkstra, and layered graph drawing.

4. **Timeline**

  April 8 - sync to complete project proposal and team contract

  April 9 - submit project proposal and team contract

  April 12 - set up initial repository and Makefile

  April 15 - finish parsing class data from CIS API to usable form.

  April 19 - convert CIS Data into graph format and pass simple tests

  April 22 - write BFS iterator and verify with tests

  April 29 - write Dijikstra's and verify with tests

  May 5 - write layered graph drawing algorithm and verify with tests

  May 7 - finish report

  May 9 - sync to record final presentation

  May 11 - finish editing presentation and submit
